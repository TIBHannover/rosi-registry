<h3 id="about-this-registry">About this Registry</h3>
<p>The diversity of scientometric data sources is large – and new ones are constantly being published,
    existing ones are changing, and others are being switched off. It is almost impossible to maintain
    a complete overview. In response we are collecting and describing several data sources for
    scientometric information in this registry.</p>
<p>This registry is a product of the project <a href="http://tib.eu/rosi-project">&quot;Reference implementation for
    Scientometric Information&quot; (ROSI)</a> funded by the <a href="https://www.bmbf.de/">Federal Ministry of
    Education and Research</a> (BMBF).
    The project is located at the <a href="https://www.tib.eu/en/research-development/open-science/">Open
        Science Lab</a> of the <a href="http://tib.eu/">Leibniz Information Centre for Science and Technology</a> (TIB).
