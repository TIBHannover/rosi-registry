### Dataflow between scientometric data sources

Many data sources are including data from other sources.

This graph displays connections between the data sources listed in this registry. We created the graph with the [VOSviewer software](https://www.vosviewer.com/). The network [network](https://labs.tib.eu/rosi/includes/network.txt) and [map](https://labs.tib.eu/rosi/includes/map.txt) text files can be imported in the VOSviewer software to compute the network visualization.
